# JobSwipe

This app is currently in development.  It is a Job Searching mbile application that utilizes the Indeed API, it allows for users to find jobs based on their current or desired location. They can then like or dislike positions recommended to them in a way similar to Tinder.   Once they like some jobs, they can query another search, or apply to/share the job postings.
